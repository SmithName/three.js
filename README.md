# Three.js with GLTFLoader and Gravity

This repository contains a simple web application using Three.js to create a 3D scene with GLTFLoader for loading a GLB model. The scene includes gravity, causing the model to fall and bounce off a floor.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Web browser with WebGL support
- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   Open index.html in your preferred web browser.
File Structure
index.html: HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
three.module.js: Three.js library module.
GLTFLoader.js: Module for loading GLTF models.
boxes.glb: GLB model of boxes falling under gravity.
Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the Three.js scene. The GLB model will fall due to gravity and bounce off the floor.

Customization
Model: Replace the boxes.glb file with your own GLB model.
Gravity: Adjust the gravity vector and other physics parameters in the script to customize the falling behavior.
Dependencies
Three.js: A JavaScript 3D library.
